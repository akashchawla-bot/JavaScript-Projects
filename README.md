## HEllo Welcome to JavaScript Project.

Here we do projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Our First Project 

This project demonstrates how to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on colored buttons.  
It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling the layout and buttons, and JavaScript for handling button clicks to switch colors dynamically.

**Features:**
- Four color buttons (Grey, White, Blue, Yellow)
- Responsive layout and styled navigation bar
- Interactive background color switching

**Files:**
- [`index.html`](color%20changing%20projector/p1_index.html): Main HTML structure
- [`style.css`](color%20changing%20projector/p1_style.css): Styling for layout and buttons
- [`script.js`](color%20changing%20projector/p1_script.js): JavaScript logic for color switching

Try clicking the color buttons to see the background change!
